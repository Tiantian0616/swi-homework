获取下一个指令--解码指令--如果指令表示需要，则获取数--执行指令

 IR:指令寄存器，是临时放置从内存里面取得的程序指令的寄存器，用于存放当前从主存储器读出的正在执行的一条指令。   

 PC:程序计数器,程序计数器是用于存放下一条指令所在单元的地址的地方。   

 ACC:累加寄存器,当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行算术或逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区。累加寄存器暂时存放ALU运算的结果信息。

(1)Assembly language   
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.   
   
(2)Compiler   
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.    

(3)Imperative programming   
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.    

(4)Functional programming   
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.    

(5)Procedural programming   
rocedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
